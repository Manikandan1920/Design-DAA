Welcome to the Prisoner's Dilemma Game!
Each player can choose to either 'Cooperate' or 'Defect'.
Payoff Matrix:
If both cooperate: (3, 3)
If one defects and the other cooperates: (0, 5) or (5, 0)
If both defect: (1, 1)
Player 1, enter your choice (C for Cooperate, D for Defect): C
Player 2, enter your choice (C for Cooperate, D for Defect): D
Results:
Player 1's choice: Cooperate
Player 2's choice: Defect
Player 1's payoff: 0
Player 2's payoff: 5
